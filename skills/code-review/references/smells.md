# Smell baseline

A fixed set of Fowler code smells (*Refactoring*, ch. 3) that applies as a floor even when the repo documents no standards of its own.

A documented repo standard always overrides this baseline — where the repo endorses something a smell below would flag, suppress the smell. Every smell here is a labelled judgement call ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation, and none apply to anything tooling already enforces.

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → Rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → Extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → Move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together. → Bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → Give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same switch/if-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → Replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → Gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → Split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs nothing in scope has. → Delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → Hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → Cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → Drop the inheritance, use composition.
